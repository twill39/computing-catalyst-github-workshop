# Collaborative HTML/CSS Website Activity 🌐

### Objective
Work in a small group (2-3 students) to collaboratively build a simple webpage using GitHub forks, branches, and pull requests.

---

## 🚀 Premise

### 1. Fork This Repo
**ONLY ONE** person in your group should fork this repository.

### 2. Add Collaborators
The person who forked it should go to:
**Settings → Collaborators → Add your teammates by their GitHub usernames.**

This allows all group members to push to the same fork.

### 3. Clone Your Group’s Fork
- Each member clones the shared fork:

### 4. Create and Check Out a New Branch
- Each member creates their own branch
  
### 5. Make your HTML edits
- Open `index.html` and add your personal section in the `<main>` tag
```
  <section>
    <h2>Krishnan Tholkappian</h2>
    <p>I’m learning about GitHub collaboration and PRs!</p>
  </section>
```

### 6. Stage, commit, and push your changes to YOUR branch

### 7. Open a Pull Request
- Go to your team's fork on GitHub.
- You’ll see a banner: “Compare & pull request.” Click it.
- Create a PR to your group’s main branch. Make sure you write a description!

### 8. Approve and merge one member's PR

### 9. Look at the other PRs
- They have merge conflicts now!

---

## ⚠️ Merge Conflict

### 1. Pull changes from `main` branch into your branch

### 2. Handle the merge conflict, push your commit

### 3. Go to the PR associated with your branch, and approve it

### 4. Repeat 1-3 until all members' changes are in the `main` branch
